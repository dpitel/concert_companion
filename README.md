shows for people

First push- very beginning of either a total piece of trash or something cool- maybe even worthwhile.
The vision is this: Spotify is great- however, their concert companion app is lacking- I want to make 
something better- something that pulls concert dates from smaller indie venues that might not already be
featured in the Spotify concert suggestions- former venues that come to mind are Death By Audio in Brooklyn,
Cake Shop on the lower East Side and spots like TV Eyes, Our Wicked Lady and Union Pool (though, I'm guessing
that Union Pool events are probably already featured on Spotify). In any case, I don't think I'm reinventing
the wheel, I just used to love going to undergound metal/noise/punk shows in my 20s and recently rewatched 
an inspiring documentary about heavy music that I love (Slave to the Grind) and realized that if I KNEW 
about more upcoming shows, I'd be more tempted to make time to go to them. This might be a complete waste of
time b/c maybe Spotify (or someone else) already does a better job of this or maybe I'll get sidetracked
like I frequently do b/c I'm too busy w/something else- who knows- maybe I'll learn something... 

More technical info will come as I finish reading the various API/technical docs and start building something,
even if it's just a minimal viable product. And if anyone reads this and happens to know a good way to maybe 
make a few dollars off of this- that would be pretty rad. In any case- keep the metal heavy.
